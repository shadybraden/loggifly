#######    CONFIG TEMPLATE     #######
#
# This is a template for the config.yaml file.
# You can edit this file and remove all the parts you don't need.
# For the program to function you need to configure: 
#   - at least one container
#   - at least one notification service (ntfy or Apprise)
#   - at least one keyword (either set globally or per container)
# The rest is optional or has default values.
#
# If you want to use this file after editing it make sure to rename it to config.yaml
#
# With every container example you can see some more available configuration options
#
# I did not include the option to customize notifications in this template but
# here is a detailed explanation: https://clemcer.io/loggifly/customize-notifications

containers:

  container1: # leave blank if you only need global keywords

  container2:
    keywords:
      - keyword1               # simple keyword
      - regex: regex-patern1   # this is how to set regex patterns
      - keyword: keyword2      # another way to set a simple keyword
      

  container3:
    keywords:
      - keyword: keyword1
        attach_logfile: true  # Attach a log file to the notification
      - regex: regex-pattern1
        action: restart  # Restart the container when this regex pattern is found
      - keyword: keyword2
        action: stop     # Stop the container when this keyword is found
  
  # You can also set a lot of settings per container or per keyword
  # Here is an overview of the available settings: https://github.com/clemcer/loggifly/tree/main#-settings-overview--hierarchy-explained
