**Loggifly** is a lightweight tool for monitoring Docker container logs and sending notifications when specific keywords are detected. It supports both plain text and regular expression (regex) keywords and can attach the last 50 lines of a log file when a match is found. I originally built this for ntfy and would recommend using that since it allows for the most fine grained configuration. But Loggifly also supports Apprise which lets you send notifications to over 100 different services. 🚀

## 🚀 Features

- **🌟 100+ notification services**: Via Apprise you can send notifications to Slack, Telegram, Discord and many more services.
- **📤 Built in ntfy Support**: Send alerts to any ntfy-compatible service (self-hosted or public).
  - **🥳 Priority, Tags & Topic**: Customize priority, tags/emojis and the topic individually for each container.
- **🔍 Keyword & Regex Monitoring**: Track specific keywords or complex regex patterns in container logs.  
- **🐳 Fine-Grained Keyword Control**: You can specify keywords per container or for all containers.  
- **📁 Log Attachments**: Automatically attach a file with the last 50 log lines to notifications.  
- **⏱ Rate Limiting**: Avoid spam with per-keyword/container cooldowns.  
- **🔧 YAML Configuration**: Define containers, keywords, and notification settings in a simple config file.  
- ** Automatic Restarts**: The programm restarts when it detects that the config file has been changed.

# Loggifly Configuration 

While there are some settings you can set via environment variables most of the configuration for Loggifly happens in the config.yaml file.
You can find a detailed walkthrough of the config file [here](https://https://github.com/clemcer/loggifly/blob/main/walkthrough.md).

## 🛠 Installation Walkthrough


1. Create a folder on your system, place your config.yaml there and edit it to fit your needs and preferences.
```yaml
containers:
    vaultwarden:
      ntfy_tags: closed_lock_with_key   # if you use ntfy you can set these settings per container to overwite global settings
      ntfy_priority: 5
      ntfy_topic: security
      keywords:
        - Username or password is incorrect
        - regex: incorrect
        - username
        - password
      keywords_with_attachment:                   # send a file with the last log lines. You can set the number of lines. See 'settings' section.
        - regex: ^\[[^\]]+\]\[[^\]]+\]\[(ERROR)\] # catches all lines with Log level set to ERROR at the beginning (after the timestamp)

    audiobookshelf:           # if you don't need all the extra settings from ntfy or an attachment you can directly list your keywords here
      - failed login
      - requested download
      - downloaded item 
 
global_keywords:
  keywords:
    - segfault
    - panic
  keywords_with_attachment:
    - fatal

notifications:                       # Here you can specify your ntfy or apprise settings. Or both. 
  ntfy:                              # You could also set these settings via environment variables.                                 
    url: "your url"
    topic: "your topic"
    token: "token"
    tags: kite, mag
  apprise:
    url: discord:// # Your apprise url. For example for Discord
  
settings:                            # These are settings you could also set via environment variables
  log-level: INFO                    # Set the log level (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, FATAL)
  keyword_notification_cooldown: 5   # Set the time the programm should wait before it sends you a notificatin from the same service and keyword
  attachment_lines: 10               # Set the number of log lines in the log file attached to your notification 
  disable_start_message: False       # Disable the message you get when the programm starts
  disable_shutdown_message: False    # Disable the message you get when the programm shuts down
  disable_restart: False             # Disable that the programm restarts when your config file changes
```

### Installation via Docker Compose

2. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in your project and adjust it to your needs. In the volumes section you will have to specify the path to your config file.
If you want, you can set all of the global settings (that are not defined per container) in your compose via environment variables. Here is a list of the options. (Or use an .env file)

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  Loggifly:
    image: ghcr.io/clemcer/Loggifly:latest
    container_name: Loggifly
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./Loggifly/config/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml # specify the path of your condig file on the left side of the mapping
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. Then, run the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
